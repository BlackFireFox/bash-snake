Something to Say
---------------
 * Almisael has two processes, the foreground one responds to 
   user's control commands, the background one draws the board.

 * Use $! to grasp the PID of the latest created background process.

 * Use kill and trap to enable communication between the two processes.

 * When setting up several traps, it's necessary to guarantee that 
   the normal execution will not be interrupted by the signal handling 
   if the handlers envolve modification of some variables it depends on.
